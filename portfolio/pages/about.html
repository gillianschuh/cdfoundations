        <p width= 50%> Gillian Schuh was born and raised in Atlanta, GA where she first discovered her passion for art and design. Now, she is a New York City based artist in her second year at Parsons School of Design with a major in Strategic Design and Management and with two minors in Communication Design and Art History. Gillian explores her passion for art through experimenting with different mediums, including embroidery, printmaking, and wood burning. However, Gillian now primarily focuses her design skills towards graphic design as she finds the medium works most synonymously matches her style of bright colors and graphic compositions.
In high school, Gillian was an IB Art student. She has been recognized for her accomplishments as she received first place in the Pace Photography competition and was a finalist in the Georgia Governerâ€™s Honors Program. </p>
